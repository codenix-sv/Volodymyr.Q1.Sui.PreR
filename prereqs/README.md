- Read these documents
  - https://docs.sui.io/concepts/sui-move-concepts
  - https://docs.sui.io/concepts/object-model
- Set Up and Install Sui https://docs.sui.io/guides/developer/getting-started/sui-install#install-sui-binaries
- Create a folder in a GitHub repository and name it your.name.Q1.Sui.PreR
- Put all the following in the folder. 
- Go to Sui By Example - create a new package with: 

  ```
  sui move new prereqs 
  ```

- In the package, complete the Sui Move examples found in the [Sui By Example](https://examples.sui.io/) resource, but you will want to adjust function, object, variables names to reflect a more “real” use case that’s interesting to you.  We recommend you hand slug these examples to build muscle memory.
